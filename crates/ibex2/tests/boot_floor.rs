//! The boot floor: what the runtime costs before a single module is loaded.
//!
//! LLP 0057 §7 is explicit that nothing in Ibex 2 had been measured against
//! the 30 ms budget in `rules/RULES.md`, "because nothing here is built".
//! Enough is built to measure the floor — everything a program pays before its
//! own code runs — even though the module loader that would complete the
//! picture does not exist yet.
//!
//! Run with:
//!     cargo test -p ibex2 --features hermes --release --test boot_floor -- --ignored --nocapture
