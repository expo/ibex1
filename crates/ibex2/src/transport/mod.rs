//! Transports: the platform half of the sandwich.
//!
//! LLP 0057 §3 draws the line here. Everything above — header folding, redirect
//! policy, the body state machine, the error taxonomy — is Rust's and is
//! identical on every platform. Everything below is the operating system's:
//! sockets, TLS, proxy configuration, HTTP/2 and /3, connection pooling, and
//! the certificate store. Inverting that gives four platforms four different
//! `fetch`es, which is the failure a cross-platform runtime exists to prevent.
//!
//! @ref LLP 0057#3-the-boundary — Rust owns semantics, the platform owns transport
