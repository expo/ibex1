//! The module loader: resolution, wrapping, and per-module authority.

//! This is where LLP 0067's properties are actually enforced. R1 (nothing
//! capability-bearing on the global object), R2 (each module receives its
//! bindings as parameters of its own scope), and R5 (the global name list is
//! asserted) are properties of *this* file, not of the boundary below it.
//!
//! **v1 is CommonJS-shaped and loads from source.** Not because that is the
