//! The host-call boundary.
//!
//! LLP 0059.000 §1: one surface, primitives and handles only, no JSON, and the
//! capability check before dispatch.
//!
//! **A clarification this module had to settle.** §1.2 says host calls are
//! async by default, with the sync exceptions named in §2 (`localStorage`,
//! `performance.now`). Read literally that makes `new URL()` and
//! `TextEncoder.encode()` asynchronous, which is impossible — they are
//! synchronous web APIs and no application can await them. The rule being
//! expressed is LLP 0057 §3's: *no new synchronous cross-thread call surface*.
//! A **pure** op (the Summary's first shape) computes on the calling thread and
//! never leaves it, so it is not a cross-thread call and returns directly.
//! Async-by-default governs the **delegating** and **ambient** shapes, which do
//! leave the thread. Everything in this module is pure; nothing here may block.
//!
//! @ref LLP 0059.000#1-the-host-call-boundary — the surface this implements
//! @ref LLP 0057#3-the-boundary — Rust owns semantics, the platform owns transport
